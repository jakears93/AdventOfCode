Incomplete and Need to Solve:
    Day 17A & B ->  Some sort of dijkstra algorithm implementation
    Day 19B -> Should be similar to day 5 solution using ranges and recursively splitting

Optimizations/Refactoring:
    Day 5B -> Optimize by using ranges instead of brute force
    Day 20B -> Refactor need as it only works for current goal signal rx-LOW
